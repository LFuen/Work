            <p className='item'>I've been a massage therapist for a decade. No, that has nothing to do with programming, HOWEVER, the opportunity to dive 
                into coding and make it a career almost literally fell into my lap. Thanks to COVID (remember that?), I had a mind-shift and decided I would  
                do something that would challenge and intellectually stimulate me. I've had various career lines, from teaching biology, coaching high school softball, 
                real estate underwriting, and even a professional wolverine wrangler. Ok, that last one was just a test to see if you were still with me! 
                But it would <i>totally</i> be exciting, not to mention absolutely terrifying! I love collaborating in every job that I've ever had, 
                and I would love the chance to pick the brains of great developers and coders out there!</p>

            <p className='item'>When I'm not behind a computer though, I'm not even indoors. I just moved to Maryland from living my entire life in the
                    hot and muggy Florida sun, down in Miami. I fell in love with Maryland when I visited a couple of years back and I 
                    decided to make it my new home in 2019. Hiking, photography, and art are my go-to's when I'm not hacking away at a keyboard. This is where
                    my love of front-end and design comes in.</p>
